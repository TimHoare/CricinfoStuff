# CricinfoStuff

This is an example of one of my early projects as a learning exercise when starting to use R. The idea here is to obtain information from 
www.espncricinfo.com about test matches and tidy the data. Included in this repository are the scripts scrape the website and to tidy the 
data, the final result in csv format, and a .md file explaining the process.
